Ravenous, a Restaurant Search App

A React web app that searches for restaurants using the Yelp API to access real-life restaurant information.

Ravenous functionality: A user can search for restaurants in a chosen location, view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API and sort through restaurants using a filter. There are three search filters - "Best Match", "Highest Rated", and "Most Reviewed". I used my knowledge of JavaScript and React to create static components, pass information to components, set and manage the state, and interact with the Yelp API.
